# Spring Kafka Producer Side Cheat Sheet - Master Level

## 2.1 KafkaTemplate

### 2.1.1 Synchronous vs Asynchronous send

**Definition**
KafkaTemplate supports both synchronous sending with immediate result blocking and asynchronous sending with callback-based result handling, enabling different performance and reliability patterns for message publishing. Synchronous operations use send().get() pattern for immediate confirmation while asynchronous operations use callback mechanisms or CompletableFuture integration for non-blocking publishing patterns with better throughput characteristics.

**Key Highlights**
Synchronous sending blocks thread execution until broker acknowledgment providing immediate error handling and delivery confirmation but limiting throughput due to thread blocking and request serialization. Asynchronous sending enables higher throughput through non-blocking operations while requiring callback handling for error processing and delivery confirmation with potential complexity in error recovery scenarios. Performance characteristics differ significantly with async operations supporting 5-10x higher throughput while sync operations provide simpler error handling and immediate result processing.

**Responsibility / Role**
Synchronous sending coordinates immediate result processing with thread blocking while providing simple error handling and delivery confirmation for applications requiring immediate feedback and low-latency response patterns. Asynchronous sending manages callback registration and execution while coordinating with Spring's async infrastructure and thread pools for high-throughput scenarios and non-blocking application patterns. Error handling coordination differs between patterns with sync providing immediate exception propagation while async requires callback-based error processing and recovery strategies.

**Underlying Data Structures / Mechanism**
Synchronous implementation uses Future.get() blocking pattern while coordinating with underlying Kafka producer send operation and broker acknowledgment cycles for immediate result availability. Asynchronous implementation uses callback registration with ListenableFuture or CompletableFuture integration while managing callback execution on appropriate thread pools and error propagation mechanisms. Spring integration provides async template methods with callback coordination while maintaining compatibility with Spring's async processing infrastructure and reactive programming models.

**Advantages**
Synchronous sending provides immediate error handling and simplified programming model while ensuring delivery confirmation before method return enabling straightforward error recovery and application logic flow.
