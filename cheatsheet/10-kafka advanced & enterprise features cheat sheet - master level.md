# Kafka Advanced & Enterprise Features Cheat Sheet - Master Level

## 10.1 Transactions & EOS

### Idempotency vs Transactions

**Definition**
Idempotency provides duplicate detection and prevention within individual partitions using producer IDs and sequence numbers, while transactions extend exactly-once semantics across multiple partitions and topics through distributed transaction coordination with two-phase commit protocols. Idempotency operates at producer-partition level preventing duplicates during retries, while transactions provide atomicity guarantees across complex multi-partition operations including external system coordination.

**Key Highlights**
Idempotent producers use 64-bit producer IDs with 32-bit sequence numbers per partition enabling 2 billion unique records per partition per producer session without external coordination overhead. Transactional producers require unique transactional.id configuration enabling producer session recovery and zombie producer detection across application restarts with automatic coordinator assignment and session management. Transaction scope includes multiple topic-partition writes, consumer offset commits, and external system coordination through application-managed transaction boundaries with configurable timeout and isolation levels.

**Responsibility / Role**
Idempotency manages producer-level deduplication through broker-side sequence validation preventing duplicate records during retry scenarios while maintaining high throughput and minimal coordination overhead. Transactional coordination manages distributed transaction state including participant registration, two-phase commit protocols, and transaction marker generation ensuring atomicity across multiple partitions and consumer group coordination. Both mechanisms coordinate with exactly-once processing guarantees while providing different scopes and performance characteristics for various reliability requirements and architectural patterns.

**Underlying Data Structures / Mechanism**
Idempotent producer implementation uses producer ID allocation from coordinator brokers with per-partition sequence numbers stored in broker memory for duplicate detection and sequence gap identification. Transactional coordination uses dedicated transaction coordinators managing transaction state in __transaction_state topic with participant tracking, timeout management, and recovery procedures during coordinator failover scenarios. Transaction markers written to participant partitions enable consumer isolation and consistent transaction visibility while automatic cleanup prevents unbounded transaction metadata growth and resource usage.

**Advantages**
Idempotency provides exactly-once guarantees within partition boundaries with minimal performance overhead (typically <5% throughput reduction) while requiring no external coordination or complex application logic for duplicate prevention. Transactional processing enables complex exactly-once patterns including multi-partition atomic writes, consumer offset coordination, and external system integration with strong consistency guarantees across distributed operations. Both mechanisms integrate seamlessly with existing Kafka clients and provide transparent operation for applications requiring reliability guarantees without significant architectural changes.

**Disadvantages / Trade-offs**
Idempotency limitations to single-partition scope prevent cross-partition exactly-once guarantees while producer ID exhaustion after 2 billion records requires session renewal with potential temporary unavailability affecting application throughput. Transactional processing overhead reduces producer throughput by 20-40% due to coordination protocols and two-phase commit latency while increasing complexity for error handling and timeout management. Transaction coordinator capacity becomes bottleneck for high-transaction-rate applications while transaction timeouts can cause automatic aborts affecting application logic and error handling requirements.

**Corner Cases**
Producer ID conflicts during coordinator failover can cause temporary unavailability while sequence number gaps trigger producer errors requiring application restart and potentially affecting exactly-once guarantees during failure scenarios. Transaction coordinator failures during commit phase can cause transaction state uncertainty requiring manual investigation and potentially data consistency verification across affected partitions and consumer applications. Zombie producer detection delays can affect transaction processing during network partitions while transaction timeout edge cases can cause unexpected transaction aborts during legitimate long-running operations.

**Limits / Boundaries**
Idempotent producer sessions support 2 billion records per partition with 15-minute default session timeout while concurrent idempotent producers per broker limited by memory allocation for sequence tracking typically supporting thousands of concurrent sessions. Transaction timeout ranges from 1 second to 15 minutes (default 60 seconds) with coordinator capacity typically supporting thousands of concurrent transactions depending on coordinator hardware and configuration. Maximum transaction participants limited by coordinator memory and network capacity while transaction marker overhead affects partition storage and cleanup performance.

**Default Values**
Idempotency disabled by default (enable.idempotence=false), transaction timeout defaults to 60 seconds (transaction.timeout.ms=60000), and transaction coordinator selection uses hash-based assignment. Producer ID timeout defaults to 15 minutes (transactional.id.timeout.ms=900000) while transaction state topic uses 50 partitions by default with 3x replication factor for coordinator fault tolerance.

**Best Practices**
Enable idempotency for all production producers requiring reliability while using transactions only when cross-partition atomicity is essential due to performance overhead and complexity considerations. Configure appropriate transaction timeouts based on expected processing time and network characteristics while implementing comprehensive error handling for transaction aborts and coordinator failures. Monitor transaction metrics including success rates, coordinator health, and zombie producer detection effectiveness ensuring transaction system health and optimal performance for exactly-once processing requirements.
