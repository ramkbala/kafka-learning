# ksqlDB (Streaming SQL for Kafka) Cheat Sheet - Master Level

## 9.1 Streams vs Tables

**Definition**
ksqlDB Streams represent unbounded sequences of immutable events with append-only semantics enabling temporal processing and complete event history retention, while Tables represent mutable state with key-based updates providing latest-value semantics for stateful processing patterns. Stream-Table duality enables seamless conversion through aggregations (Stream-to-Table) and changelog emission (Table-to-Stream) supporting complex stream processing topologies with SQL abstractions.

**Key Highlights**
Streams preserve all records including duplicates with temporal ordering for event-driven processing while Tables automatically compact data maintaining only latest value per key for state-oriented operations and lookup patterns. Stream operations include filtering, transformation, and temporal windowing while Table operations focus on key-based lookups, joins, and stateful aggregations with automatic state management. Conversion semantics enable sophisticated processing patterns including event aggregation into state tables and state change propagation as event streams with SQL declarative syntax.

**Responsibility / Role**
Stream processing coordinates event ingestion, transformation, and temporal analysis while maintaining complete event history and supporting exactly-once processing semantics for audit trails and business intelligence requirements. Table management handles stateful operations including key-based updates, compaction coordination, and materialized view maintenance while providing consistent state access for real-time queries and business logic evaluation. Duality coordination enables complex processing topologies combining event processing with state management through SQL abstractions and automatic optimization.

**Underlying Data Structures / Mechanism**
Stream implementation uses Kafka topics with append-only semantics while maintaining record ordering and temporal characteristics through partition-based processing and offset management coordination.
